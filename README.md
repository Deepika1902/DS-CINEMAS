# DS-CINEMAS

The "Streamline Cinema: Online Movie Ticket Booking" project is a dynamic and user-friendly web application designed to revolutionize the way people purchase tickets for their favorite movies. This mini-project is focused on providing a convenient and efficient platform for moviegoers to book tickets, choose their seats, and make secure payments, all from the comfort of their own devices.
